type = internal/backlight

; Use the following command to list available cards:
; $ ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/
card = amdgpu_bl0

; (unreleased)
; Use the `/sys/class/backlight/actual-brightness` file
; rather than the regular `brightness` file.
; Defaults to true unless the specified card is an amdgpu backlight.
use-actual-brightness = true

; Enable changing the backlight with the scroll wheel
; NOTE: This may require additional configuration on some systems. Polybar will
; write to `/sys/class/backlight/${self.card}/brightness` which requires polybar
; to have write access to that file.
; DO NOT RUN POLYBAR AS ROOT.
; The recommended way is to add the user to the
; `video` group and give that group write-privileges for the `brightness` file.
; See the ArchWiki for more information:
